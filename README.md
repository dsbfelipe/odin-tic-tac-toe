This project is part of The Odin Project's Ruby course. The goal of this assignment was to create a command-line version of the classic game Tic Tac Toe. Two human players take turns marking a 3x3 grid, and the game checks for a winner or a draw after each move. This project was a great way to apply object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts like classes, instance variables, and methods.
