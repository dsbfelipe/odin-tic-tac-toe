This project is part of The Odin Project's Ruby course. The goal of this assignment was to create a command-line version of the classic game Tic Tac Toe. Two human players take turns marking a 3x3 grid, and the game checks for a winner or a draw after each move. This project was a great way to apply object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts like classes, instance variables, and methods.

## 📝 Project Objective

The objective was to build a Tic Tac Toe game where two players could alternate turns marking the board, and the game would check for a win or draw after each move. By structuring the game into distinct classes, the project emphasized clean separation of responsibilities and maintaining the game loop until a victory or draw condition was met.

## 🔧 Features

- Allows two human players to play against each other in the terminal.

- Displays the game board between turns.

- Players can input their row and column coordinates to mark their symbol (`X` or `O`).

- Checks for win conditions across rows, columns, and diagonals.

- Detects when the game results in a draw.

## 📖 Learnings

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Practiced structuring code using classes, instance variables, and methods for game logic.

- **Game Logic Development**: Improved my ability to develop and implement rules for checking win conditions and handling edge cases like a draw.

- **User Input Validation**: Gained experience in validating player inputs and handling errors.

- **Looping and Condition Handling**: Strengthened my understanding of loop structures for maintaining the game flow until a result is reached.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **Ruby** for implementing the Tic Tac Toe game logic and user interactions.

## 💡 Acknowledgments

- **The Odin Project**: For providing the project outline and guidance.
